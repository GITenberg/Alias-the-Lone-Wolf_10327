description: On the brink of retirement, the Lone Wolf risks everything for love Nearly
  forty years old, the Lone Wolf is, as his British Secret Service friend Wertheimer
  puts it, &ldquo;superannuated.&rdquo; His last adventure involved not just the surprise
  of meeting his grown daughter, but the twin shocks of seeing her fall in love with
  a secret agent and risk her own death at the hands of murderous Bolsheviks. The
  excitement has left Lanyard&mdash;or Monsieur Duchemin, as the British government
  prefers to know him&mdash;feeling slow and cranky. There is nothing to do, suggests
  Wertheimer, but retire from undercover work and leave England for good. Wertheimer
  more than suggests this, in fact; he demands it&mdash;for the Russians have made
  it known that they intend to kill the Lone Wolf and will tear apart London and every
  other corner of the British Isles to find him. Inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s
  Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes , Lanyard heads to the South of France. Hiking
  alone in the mountains, he goes to bed with the birds, rises with the sun, and considers
  what to do with the rest of his life. Visions of a dusty Parisian antique shop and
  Sunday afternoons with his grandchildren delight the Lone Wolf, but fate has something
  altogether different in store. In the eerie rock field of Montpellier-le-Vieux,
  he rescues a beautiful woman and her traveling party from highway bandits. Then
  the real danger begins. This ebook features a new introduction by Otto Penzler and
  has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.
